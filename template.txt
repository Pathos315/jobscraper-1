Dear COMPANY NAME Hiring Specialist,

I am writing to apply for the JOB POSITION position at COMPANY NAME, as listed on LinkedIn.

Did you know that over 73% of employers are having a hard time finding skilled UX Design candidates? 

Now, imagine that you've encountered a candidate that can not only do all of the necessary work of user experience design, but they can also animate, code, do graphic design, and write content. 

What if I told you that you were reading that note from that very candidate, right now?

Hi, my name's John Fallot. I'm one of the co-founders of the Prosocial Design Network, where we explore how UX Design might help people get along. I'm also certified in UX/UI Mobile Design from the Pratt Institute, have crafted gaming experiences that have received millions of views on Youtube, and I used the coding language Python to help draft and distribute this very cover letter.

As a member of the COMPANY NAME team, I could contribute the latest insights and developments in conversational health best practices. I can also provide a holistic eye to complex problems, and rapidly iterate solutions as needed to solve COMPANY NAME client needs.

I look forward to speaking with you soon. I can be reached at john.fallot@gmail.com, or by phone at 631-745-1589.

Best regards,

John Fallot
