HIRING MANAGER,

I am interested in COMPANY_NAME's
open JOB_TITLE position, which I believe reports to you.

After learning
about the opportunity from both {self.reference},
and the COMPANY_NAME website,
I believe that I could contribute the following
to COMPANY_NAME.

<b>Initiative:</b> I co-founded
the Prosocial Design Network
in response to a need
I saw in the social media industry.
People long to be
meanginfully understood online,
user interfaces were unable
to meet that need.
My ability to start new ventures
mean that I would likely
be a self-starter on projects
while working for COMPANY_NAME.

<b>Craftsmanship:</b> I've designed
over 20 playable characters for
the online game, <b>deeeep.io</b>,
assets that have gone on to garner
over 10,000,000 views on Youtube
gaming streams, while teaching dozens of kids about
design and marine biology. I've also received
praise from Google's Jigsaw team for
my work on the Prosocial Design Network's
website. For COMPANY_NAME,
this means that you can expect me
to always deliver quality and impactful contributions.

<b>Adaptability:</b> In addition to the
skills you'd expect for a
JOB_TITLE role, I can also adapt
to meet most unforseen digital needs.
I'm just as comfortable working
in Figma as I am in Illustrator,
or After Effects, or Google Sheets,
or writing Python code; and
that all means COMPANY_NAME
would be adding a competent, well-rounded,
and helpful member to their team.

In closing, I think the JOB_TITLE role
at COMPANY_NAME would be a great mutual fit.
Please do contact me at PHONE,
or EMAIL, at your earliest convenience.

Thank You For Your Consideration,<br />
